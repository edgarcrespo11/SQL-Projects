This project demonstrates foundational SQL Basic skills by performing statistical queries 
and answering custom questions I developed.


-- 1.Write a SQL query that orders the items by price.

SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc
;

-- 2.Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the item prices, like a sum, average, minimum, maximum, or count.

SELECT SUM(price)
FROM superstore
;

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM superstore
;

SELECT MAX(price)
FROM superstore
;

SELECT MIN(price)
FROM superstore
;

SELECT COUNT(price)
FROM superstore
;

-- 3.Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies"

SELECT SUM(price), category
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies'
;

SELECT COUNT(price), category
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies'
;

SELECT AVG(price), category
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies'
;

SELECT MAX(price), category
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies'
;

SELECT MIN(price), category
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies'
;

-- 4.How many air purifiers are in stock?

SELECT COUNT(item_name)
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name = 'Air Purifier'
;

-- 5.What is the most expensive Furnishings item in the store? Show the price and name of the item

SELECT MAX(price), category, item_name
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Furnishings'
GROUP BY item_name desc
;
